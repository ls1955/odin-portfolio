# Notes
1. It was after deployment that author realized that the page looks worse on a very large screen. In author own cases, the page does not look uglier than that when zooming in around 150% (which is the ratio that author was working in). As such, it
is recommend to zoom in and give the page another chance to see if the page looks slightly more acceptable, or conclude that the page
that author wrote is indeed a hot garbage. Hopefully author will do something with that in the future.

2. As it was mentioned in [TOP's project introduction](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio#introduction) that this project is the "first real project", plus author is asshamed of his past projects and doesn't feel like showing them inside the page, thus there will be no project showcase inside the page (for now).
